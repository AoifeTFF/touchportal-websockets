# touchportal-websockets
Weebsockets?! IN MY TOUCH PORTAL?! It's more likely than you think.

This plugin lets you send out generic websocket strings to any address you want.

To build: ensure you have the following installed.

```pip install websocket-client```
```pip install TouchPortal-API```

Then run make.bat

KNOWN ISSUES:
~ First signal sent takes a hot second to send. This is because connections are made on the fly.
